### Overview
As a final-year Computer Science student at Chitkara University, I have created this repository as part of the **Digital Nurture 3.0 Deep Skilling** learning program focused on ServiceNow. This 4-week program is designed to enhance my skills in various ServiceNow modules through structured self-learning resources, practical exercises, and weekly assignments. By the end of this program, I aim to have a solid foundation in ServiceNow, covering both platform and development fundamentals.
